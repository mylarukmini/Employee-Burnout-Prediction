# Employee Burnout Prediction

## Introduction

Employee burnout is a critical issue affecting productivity and well-being. This project uses machine learning to predict burnout by analyzing factors like work hours, performance metrics, and survey responses. Early identification allows organizations to support their employees effectively.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed data.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.
- `src/`: Code for data processing and model training.
- `models/`: Saved models.
- `reports/`: Summarized findings and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project description and usage instructions.

## Data

The dataset includes features such as:

- **Employee ID**: Unique identifier.
- **Work Hours**: Hours worked.
- **Performance Score**: Evaluation score.
- **Survey Responses**: Satisfaction survey responses.
- **Burnout**: Binary indicator of burnout (1 = Yes, 0 = No).

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess data, handle missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand data distribution, trends, and patterns.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate models using various algorithms.
5. **Model Evaluation and Tuning**: Optimize and validate model performance.
6. **Documentation and Reporting**: Document the process and generate reports.

## Results

The model accurately predicts burnout, identifying key influencing factors and offering recommendations to mitigate risks.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-burnout-prediction.git
   cd employee-burnout-prediction
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebooks**: Explore, preprocess, and build models in the `notebooks/` directory.
4. **Train and Evaluate Models**: Use the `src/` directory scripts to process data and train models. Saved models are in the `models/` directory.
5. **Generate Reports**: Review reports in the `reports/` directory.
